# RestAssuredProject

This is a Test Automation framework that uses RestAssured and JUnit to run the tests and generate an HTML report for the results.

The Framework uses the Pet Store API from the following link: https://petstore.swagger.io/

You can use this written documentation I wrote to build the framework yourself. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qv1I-QBJtppHMDUbp-M1djMmw32iUY902CMNmIRb8Q4/edit?usp=sharing

If you need a more visual resource, follow this YouTube playlist I followed to create the framework: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUDwpEzHYYLvLZX_QEGTNolPvNADXid0I
